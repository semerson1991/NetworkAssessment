        "Malware if short for malicious software. One specific example of this is Ransomware, "
        "which had a large impact on major companies throughout 2017. This variant of malware "
        "locks the user out from using their system until the victim makes a payment. "
        "Even when that payment has been made, the system may still be locked. n"
        "Another example is a trojan horse. This is a program that appears to be harmless, "
        "but is in fact malicious.  This can provide the attacker with many options such as "
        "giving access for attacker to control anything on the computer, record the users keyboard "
        "strokes, download and install additional malware, and activate the computers camera to spy on the user.\n"

        "It is crucial to be aware of the previous mentioned areas that can result in malware infecting "
        "the device (phishing, malicious websites, removable storage). Popular operating systems usually "
        "include anti malware software. For example, Windows has Defender, and MacOS had XProtect. "
        "These should always be enabled as will instantly increase the device security by detected malicious software.\n"
        "Although anti malware software is installed, it is important to also keep this up to date as a large number of malware "
        "is discovered daily. Installing updates will enable the anti-virus software to detect new variants that have "
        "been added to the database. \n"
        "Smartphones and tablets should be kept up to date, password protected, and where possible, the ability to track "
        "the device and erase data should be enabled. Connecting to unknown public networks can also be very dangerous and "
        "can prevent the device from being potentially infected.\n"
