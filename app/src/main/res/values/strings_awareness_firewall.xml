        "Firewall should always be used if you are connected to the internet. "
        "Firewalls provides a layer of security between your network and other networks. "
        "In short, a firewall analysis incoming traffic, to determine whether it should be allowed onto your network.\n\n"
        "The two types of firewalls are host based and network based. Host based is a personal firewall that is installed"
        "on a device such as a laptop. This Firewall will be dedicated to protecting the laptop from attackers. "
        "Network based firewall protected the whole network from attackers. For instance, a router will often contain a firewall "
        "that prevents traffic from entering the network in the first place. Both firewalls should be used to achieve a higher level "
        "of security. See the link provided for more details."
